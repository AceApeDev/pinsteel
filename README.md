# Pinocchio + Steel = Pinsteel

Pinsteel is an utility framework inspired by Steel, but rewriteen to use Pinocchio instead of Solana SDK. It provides a library of helper functions, macros, and code patterns for building safe and maintainable smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.

Enjoy smaller build times, optimized CU, no dependency hell and simple to use interface.

## FAQ

*Q: Why create another framework?*
A: This project was born while working on smart contracts for Head2Head. While there is rich variety of options to use with Solana SDK, Pinocchio is relatively new and there were no convinient libs to use.

*Q: How is it different from Anchor?*
A: While I took inspiration in some area (e.g. self-CPI logging), there is much less "magic" behaviour happening under the hood.
